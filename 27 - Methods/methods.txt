Methods are functions attached to objects

The console is an object
typeof console
>>> object

console.log is a function
typeof console.log
>>> function

We then say that the log is a method of the console object

To create a method, that is, create a function inside the object, just declare the function inside the object in a similar way to creating common functions, with the difference of not using the reserved word 'function':

let person = {
   name: 'Gabriel',
   age: 29,
   sayHello(){
     console.log('Hello world!')
   }
}

To execute the method, just invoke the object name and the function name:
//nameObject.nameOfFunction()

console.log(person)
person.sayHello()

If you want to create a method that uses a property of the object itself, you must use the reserved word 'this'. 'this' references the object it is inserted in

let person = {
   name: 'Gabriel',
   age: 29,
   sayHello(){
     console.log('Hello world!, my name is ' + this.name)
   }
}
