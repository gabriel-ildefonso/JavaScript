Objects are JavaScript frameworks for working with key-value dictionaries.

An object's key-value pair is called a "property".
  The key serves as the property name. the value, as redundant as that sounds, is the value stored in that property, similar to values stored in variables.

Unlike arrays, its elements do not have any sequence. It is not an ordered collection of items.

A property can also contain strings, numbers and/or Booleans as a key.

A property can store any amount of valuable data.

Objects can be created using braces {}
   //let object = {}

Its properties and functions can be referenced by dot "." or square brackets [ ]
   object.prop = 'hello world!'
   object.method()

  let name = 'name'
  object[name] = 'hello world!
  object.prop === object[name]
  let function = 'console.log'
  object[function]() //usa o dinamismo para juntar strings e criar a função object[console.log]

const person = {}
person.name = 'Gabriel'
person.age = '29'
person.friends = ['Chandler', 'Joey', 'Monica', 'Phoebe', 'Ross', 'Rachel']
person.adress = '90, Bedford St, Greenwich Village, New York'
