Function is a structure that allows you to declare a procedure and execute it programmatically.

A function can be seen as:
1 - Entrance

2 - procedure

3 - Exit

Both the input and the output of a function are optional, that is, a function can exist without one of them or without both.

Function inputs are called 'parameters'.
The function outputs are called 'return'.

Syntax:

function functionName(entry) {
   //procedure
  
   return
}
