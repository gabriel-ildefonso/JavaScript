D.O.M. is the acronym for Document Object Model, and it is a model of the html page. The html page is commonly referred to in JavaScript as the 'html document', and the DOM is a transformation of that entire document into a JavaScript object. As if we created a model of our page in the form of an object.

The application of the DOM is to allow a document written in markup language (html, xml, yaml, etc.) to be accessed by JavaScript. This is done through the creation, by the DOM, of a tree of objects (tree data structure).

Exemplo:
html code:
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Some title</h1>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing...</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>text</td>
        <td>text</td>
        <td>text</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>text</td>
        <td>text</td>
        <td>text</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>

D.O.M.:
html
  body
    h1
    p
    table
      tr
        td
        td
        td
      tr
        td
        td
        td

The DOM allows that, through JavaScript, it is possible to access these elements and manipulate them, such as:
- read the elements;
- create new elements;
- delete elements;
- modify elements;
- modify styles;
- etc.

Through the browser, it is possible to access the DOM through the 'document' object. To access it, just follow these steps:
1 - Open the browser console;
2 - type 'document' and press 'enter'
