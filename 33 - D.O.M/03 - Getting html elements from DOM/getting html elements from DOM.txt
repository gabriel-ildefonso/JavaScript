As said before, the DOM allows the reading of specific elements of the html. For that, there are several different ways that can be used, the choice will depend on what you want to do.

> Get multiple elements in an HTMLCollection:
   document.getElementsByTagName()
   document.getElementsByClassName()

> Get multiple elements in a NodeList:
   document.getElementsByName()
   document.querySelectorAll()

> Get a single element:
   document.getElementById()
   document.querySelector()

In practice, create a function, and inside it, create a variable that will receive the elements provided by the DOM. Like this:

function anyName(){
   let variable = document.getElementById('name_of_the_Id')
   console.log(variable)
}
