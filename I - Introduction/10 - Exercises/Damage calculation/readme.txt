## Damage Calculation

Write a program that allows you to enter the name and attack power of a character, then the name, the amount of life points, the defense power of another character and if he has a shield, and then calculate the amount of damage done based on the following rules:

- If the attack power is greater than the defense and the defender doesn't have a shield, the damage dealt will be equal to the difference between the attack and the defense.

- If the attack power is greater than the defense and the defender has a shield, the damage dealt will be equal to half the difference between the attack and defense.

- If the attack power is less than or equal to the defense, the damage dealt will be 0.

Finally, the program must subtract the amount of damage from the amount of life points of the defending character and display on the screen the amount of damage and updated information for both characters.
