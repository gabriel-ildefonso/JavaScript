CONDITIONAL STRUCTURES

IF and ELSE

Allows you to create blocks of code that will be executed only when a certain logical operation returns true
Blocks of code that will only be executed if a certain condition (logical operation) is met/true. If the expression used as a condition does not return a boolean value, JavaScript will then try to convert the result of the expression to a boolean value.

IF condition === true THEN execute

if (6 === 6) {
  console.log("true")
}

In addition, ELSE (else) can be used to add a block of code that will be executed only when the same logical condition is false.

if (6 === 6) {
  console.log("true")
} else{
  console.log("false")
}

Syntax:

IF condition === true THEN execute1 ELSE execute2

Ternary operator joining IF and ELSE on the same line
let result = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false
