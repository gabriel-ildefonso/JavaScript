FOR
It also serves to perform repetitions, however, with a different structure than "while" and "do while".

It is used to abbreviate code in cases that follow this specific structure:

Initialization: instruction that is executed first of all. A common method is to create a variable at 'for' initialization;;
Condition: condition similar to 'while', it is tested before the execution of the repeating block
Finalization: expression executed after the repetition block

FOR initialization; condition; finalization DO_SOMETHING

Each of these structures is optional, but the ";" must appear within the structure, to indicate that the lack of elements is intentional

An example of a common use of for is when we want to iterate a fixed number of times, such as once for each letter in a word, or once for each item in a list.

Syntax:

for(initialization; condition; finalization){
  command
}
