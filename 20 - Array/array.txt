ARRAY

The Array is its own framework for working with all kinds of lists. Its elements are identified by an integer index, starting with "0".

The array can store any type of data and be of any size.


The array can be created and used using square brackets [], where each element of the array is separated by a comma

let array = []
array[0] = 'hello'
array[1] = 42

Arrays have functions for each of the various use cases:

a - Queuing and unqueuing
b - Stack and unstack
c - Find the index of a value
d - cut and concatenate
e - etc
