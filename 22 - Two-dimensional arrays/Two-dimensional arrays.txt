As its name suggests, a two-dimensional array is an array that has two dimensions.

In practice, it is an array that contains other arrays inside. 

Just start the new array with a square bracket.

An array can have infinite dimensions, just create new arrays to create new dimensions.

To instantiate an element from one array within another array, simply chain the square brackets: 
// console.log(array[0][1])

An interesting command when working with arrays is console.table(). With it, JS tries to display the contents in table form, if possible.

It is also possible to iterate on multidimensional arrays.

All functions used in one-dimensional arrays, such as pop(), push(), unshift(), also work with multidimensional arrays, just use the square brackets to reference the location of the array you want to change.
