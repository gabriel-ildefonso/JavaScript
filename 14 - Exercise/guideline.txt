## Visiting New Cities

Write a javascript program that asks for the name of a tourist and then asks if he has visited any city. If the answer is yes, ask for the name of the city and store it in a variable, and then keep asking if the tourist visited any other city until the answer is no. At the end, the program should display the name of the tourist, how many and which cities he visited.
