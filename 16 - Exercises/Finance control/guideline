## Financial control

Write a javascript program that starts by asking for the initial amount of money available and then displays that amount along with options to add and remove money and an option to exit. When clicking on the option to add money, the program should ask for the amount to be added, add that value to the initial amount and then show the menu again with the amount of money and the options. The remove money option should do the same, but subtracting the value. The exit option should terminate the program.
