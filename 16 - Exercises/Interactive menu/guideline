## Interactive Menu

Write a javascript program that simulates an interactive menu with 5 different options. The program should start showing the 5 available options, the first four do not need any specific functionality, the last option should be the option “Exit”. When clicking on one of the first four options, a message should be displayed on the screen indicating which option was chosen and then the program should again display the menu with the 5 options. This should keep happening until the user chooses the “Exit” option. When choosing it, a message saying that the system is being closed must be displayed on the screen and then the program is finished.
