Write a javascript program to simulate a deck of cards. The program should start showing an interactive menu on the screen containing the amount of cards that are currently in the deck and the options “Add a card”, “Pull a card” and “Exit”. When choosing “Add a card”, the program should ask for the name of the card and add it to the top of the deck. When choosing “Pull a card”, the program must remove the card from the top of the deck and show the name of the card drawn on the screen. The program must only be closed when choosing the “Exit” option, otherwise it must return to the menu.
