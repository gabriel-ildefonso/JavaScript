Write a javascript program to simulate a queue at a doctor's office. The program should start showing on the screen an interactive menu containing the list of all patients waiting in order showing their position next to the name (1st Mathew, 2nd Jack, etc). The menu should also allow choosing between the options of “New patient”, to add a new patient to the end of the queue (asking for the patient’s name), “Consult patient”, which removes the first patient from the queue and shows the name on the screen of the consulted patient, and “Exit”. The program must only be closed when choosing the “Exit” option, otherwise it must return to the menu.
